# Data Preprocessing Assignment

## Dataset Description
- This is the subset of the data that we are going to use to build our Recommender system, so before doing anything in the domain of Machine Learning it is very important for you to have a very good understanding of the data.
- A high quality data always leads to good ouutputs.
- The dataset contains information about Spotify tracks across 125 different genres. Each track is associated with various audio features. The dataset has a total of 25 columns.

## Task

Your task is to perform data preprocessing on this dataset. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming the data if necessary.

## Steps to Follow

1. Load the dataset into a suitable data structure (e.g., pandas DataFrame).
2. Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify any issues.
3. Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting any inconsistencies.
4. Analyze the data to identify outliers and decide how to handle them.
5. Transform the data if necessary, such as scaling numerical features or encoding categorical variables.
6. Document your preprocessing steps and explain the rationale behind each decision.
7. You may use relevant visualization wherever needed.


## Submission

- Submit your assignment as a markdown file, including the code snippets and explanations for each preprocessing step.
Because it is important that you understand what you're doing.
- As discussed earlier the assignment submission can be done indiviually or in group (up cap of 3 ).

Good luck!
